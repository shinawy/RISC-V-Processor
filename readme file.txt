I attached two different projects one for the FPGA and one for the simulation.
The memory reads from the file just fine in the simulation and I created a cpp program
that converts the results from RARS into little indian with spaces. It is in BinaryParsing 
directory. This did not work with the FPGA so I created another cpp program to print the fill statements for me and it is in the FillMem directory. 


The source files are in the directory of source files, but If you wanted to test the program, kindly open the project itself for that matter.

All the test cases provided in the TestCases directory divided into subdirectories representing the stage of testing.
